# Harmonica
Harmonica is a Discord bot library/boilerplate that is based upon the [Harmony library](https://github.com/harmonyland/harmony). It is vaguely inspired by its built-in command system, as well as [Discord.js Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando), but it is designed to take even more of the legwork out of the picture, as well as providing a similarly extensible way to subscribe to and handle non-message events.

The goal of this library is to get set up and running with a Discord bot incredibly quickly (the entry point of the bot is only 20 lines!), while still providing you with the flexibility you need to make a fully-functional Discord bot, big or small. It also provides some builtin commands, such as a help function and a way to dynamically reload the currently loaded commands, so that you don't have to write the same commands over and over again.

Harmonica is VERY work in progress right now, and is not at all designed for use in production bots. For examples on how to use the framework, take a look at [the test folder](https://github.com/invalidCards/Harmonica/tree/master/test), which includes an example bot that I also use to test the library.
